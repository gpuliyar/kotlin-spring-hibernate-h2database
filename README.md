A sample project that uses Kotlin + Spring + Hibernate + H2 Database

## What is this project not?
The sample project is not to learn Kotlin or Spring or Hibernate or H2 database. If you intend to learn how to code in Kotlin or how to use Spring and Hibernate framework or what is H2 database and how to build quick PoC solutions using H2 database, then Google a bit more using more precise keywords to help you. The Project assumes that you are already aware of Kotlin code, aware of what is Spring and Hibernate frameowork and H2 database.

## What is this Project?
The sample Project uses Kotlin code and uses Spring and Hibernate Framework as a Stand-Alone application to store data into the H2 database. 
If you are familiar with Kotlin coding; 
And know the inner workings (at least a little bit) of Spring and Hibernate; 
And have built PoC solution using H2 database (or at least heard of it and knows it theoretically); 
But doesn't yet know how to code a simple Standalone application written in Kotlin using Spring and Hibernate to store data in H2 database, then you landed on the right page.
